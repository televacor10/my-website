                <h2>Buddha Once Said: </h2>
            </div>
        </div>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    If you truly love yourself, you could never
                    hurt another
                </li>
                <li>
                    Hatred does not cease through hatred at any
                    time.Hatred ceases through love.This is unalterable law.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Happiness does not depend on what you have or who
                    you are.It solely relies on what  you think.
                </li>
                <li>
                    It is ridiculous to think that somebody else can make
                    you happy or unhappy.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Happiness never decreases by being shared.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Happiness is not having a lot but happiness is giving a lot
                </li>
                <li>
                    If anything is worth doing, do it with all heart.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Do not dwell in the past, do not dream of the
                    future, concentrate the mind on the present  moment.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Have compassion for all beings, rich and poor alike;
                    each has their suffering. Some suffer too much, others
                    too little.
                </li>
                <li>
                    An idea that is developed and put into action is more
                    important than an idea that exist only as an idea
                </li>
                <li>
                    One moment can change a day, one day can change a life
                    and one life can change the world.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Nothing ever exists entirely alone; everything is
                    in relation to everything else.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If the problem can be solved why worry? If the problem
                    cannot be solved worrying will do you no good.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In the sky, there is no distinction of east or west,
                    people create distinctions out of their minds and
                    then believe them to be truth.
                </li>
                <li>
                    People with opinions just go around bothering one another.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you find no one to support you on the spiritual path,
                    walk alone. There is no companionship with immature.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Everything that has a beginning has an ending.
                    make your peace with that and all will be well.

                    " The Greatest quotes of Martin Luther "
                </h1>
            </div>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Every man must decide whether he will walk in the
                    light of creative altruism or in the darkness of
                    destructive selfishness.
                </li>
                <li>
                    There is nothing more tragic than to find and individual
                    bogged down in the length of life, devoid of breadth
                </li>

                <li>
                    We must use time creatively, in the knowledge that the
                    time is always ripe to do right
                </li>
                <li>
                    The function of education is to teach one to think intensively
                     and to think critically. Intelligence plus character-that is goal
                     of education.
                </li>
                <li>
                    There can be no deep disappointment where there is no deep love.
                </li>
                <li>
                    It is not enough to say  we must not wage war. It is
                    necessary to love peace and sacrifice for it.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you can't fly the run, If you can't run then walk, if
                    you can't walk then crawl, but whatever you do you have to keep
                     moving forward.
                </li>
                <li>
                    No one really knows why they are alive until they know
                    what they'd die for.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A man who won't die for something is not fit to live.
                </li>
                <li>
                   We must build dikes of courage to hold back the flood of fear.
                </li>
                <li>
                    We must accept finite disappointment, but never lose infinite hope.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Whatever your life's work is,do it well. A man
                     should do his job so well that the living, the
                     dead, and the unborn could do it no better.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Our lives begin to end the day we become silent
                     about things that matter.
                </li>
                <li>
                   Nothing in all the world is more dangerous than
                    sincere ignorance and conscientious stupidity.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If I cannot do great things, I can do small things
                     in a great way.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Change does not roll in on the wheels of inevitability,
                    but comes through continuous struggle.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Almost always, the creative dedicated minority
                    has made the world better.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I am not interested in power for power's sake, but I'm
                    interested in power that is moral, that is right
                    and that is good.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The ultimate tragedy is not the oppression and cruelty
                    by the bad people but the silence over that by the
                    good people
                </li>
                <li>
                    We must learn to live together as brothers or perish together
                    as fools.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Never forget that everything Hitler did in Germany was legal.
